# Debugging and Iterative Fixes

Prompt Focus:
- Diagnose integrity constraint violations
- Identify root causes of import, path, and schema errors
- Resolve issues without weakening constraints

Author Decisions:
- Constraints were never removed to "make it work"
- Bugs were fixed by improving generation logic
- Schema integrity was treated as a correctness oracle

AI Role:
AI assisted in debugging by reasoning through stack traces and suggesting fixes.
Final decisions and validations were made by the author.
