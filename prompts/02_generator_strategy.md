# Data Generation Strategy

Prompt Focus:
- Generate large-scale realistic seed data
- Avoid uniform random distributions
- Model real workplace behavior (partial completion, delegation, overdue work)

Author Decisions:
- Chose weighted distributions for roles, projects, and task completion
- Introduced controlled randomness to simulate human behavior
- Ensured generators follow strict dependency ordering

AI Role:
AI assisted in validating generation logic and highlighting edge cases.
All distributions and thresholds were explicitly chosen by the author.
