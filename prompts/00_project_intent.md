# Project Intent Prompt

Goal:
Design a realistic Asana-like dataset suitable for training AI agents on task
management workflows.

Constraints:
- No real Asana data or APIs
- No web scraping
- No machine learning models
- Focus on data realism and relational integrity

AI Usage:
AI was used as a design and reasoning assistant to validate schema structure,
suggest edge cases, and review realism assumptions. All architectural decisions,
distributions, and constraints were explicitly defined and enforced by the
author.
